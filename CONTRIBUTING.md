Issues should only be used to file bug reports and ask questions that are targeted specifically at **this** project's source code.

## Information Quality
Every constructive contribution is highly appreciated.
They help to keep this project up-to-date and running, especially because currently only voluntary maintainers and contributors take care of this repository.

At the same time it is strongly recommended to follow certain guidelines when making contributions to open source projects like this one.
They ensure fast processing times and stable releases.

Before changing anything in the code base, make sure to look into [the project's README](https://github.com/dargmuesli/nuxt-cookie-control/blob/master/README.md) and its [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/dargmuesli/nuxt-cookie-control/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
This project's code follows simple and consistent code conventions, which should be easy to grasp.
If not: always try to build the project on your machine first to catch mistakes!
It saves your time to be in the clear about those conventions as it significantly lowers the probability to receive change requests from maintainers and thereby the time until merge.

Issues that do not provide enough information, that are unclear or not understandable will be closed until more qualitative information is provided.

## Contribution Completeness
A contribution has to be *complete* to get accepted.
If you cannot complete the requirements, you're welcome to ask for help.
But bear in mind that this can take some time.

A complete contribution implements a feature or a bug fix and keeps all [automated checks](https://github.com/dargmuesli/nuxt-cookie-control/actions) green! They should stay green as long as you can build the project on your machine.
